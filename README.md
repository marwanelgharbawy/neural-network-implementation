## Convolutional Neural Network Models

They consist of multiple layers including convolutional layers, pooling layers (using max pooling), then they can be repeated again, and finally fully connected layers as feed forward networks. The pooling layers help to reduce the spatial dimensions and preserve the important information of the features to capture high level patterns in the images and prevent overfitting.
